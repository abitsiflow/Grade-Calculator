# Grade-Calculator
A simple Java console program that lets users input subjects and grades, then calculates the total and average. Built to practice arrays, loops, and user input handling with Scanner. This project reflects my learning progress in Java fundamentals and basic program flow.


This is a simple console-based Java program that allows users to input subjects and grades, then computes the total and average grade.

The project focuses on:

Using arrays to store related data (subjects and grades)

Handling user input with Scanner

Applying loops for data processing

Understanding program state (when data exists vs. not yet entered)

Practicing basic logic for calculations and flow control

This project was built as part of my Phase 1 Java practice, focusing on strengthening fundamentals such as arrays, loops, and input handling.
It is intentionally kept simple and reflects my learning progress rather than a finished or optimized system.

Future improvements may include:

Input validation

Better separation of concerns (OOP design)

Support for multiple students

Refactoring arrays into collections or objects
